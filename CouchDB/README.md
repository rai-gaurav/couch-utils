This utility is inspired from -https://github.com/mojolicious/mojo/wiki/Using-CouchDB-and-Mojo-UserAgent

I just have created it more modular with proper function name so that it is easy to use.

Use can even use LWP::UserAgent to perform the same operation.
I will try to do the similar thing using that in future.
